Metadata is independent and can either be stored together with the resources it describes or separately. Metadata plays a key role in the future of your stored research data: it contains important information which for example enables you and others to search for and find your data.\nA metadata set consists mainly of descriptive categories, the so-called elements and their values. To facilitate communication with other systems, predefined standards are used for the elements and controlled vocabularies for the values."
